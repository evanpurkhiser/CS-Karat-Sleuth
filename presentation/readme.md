### Karat Sleuth presentation

This is for our project proposal presentation. It's written in markdown and
rendered as a presentation using
[Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

#### Editing

For a basic overview of markdown see [John Gruber's
documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Though the
[markdown parser](https://github.com/chjj/marked) reveal.js uses actually
supports quite a few more extensions.

You will want to edit the `presentation.md` file. Each slide is separated by
two empty lines. 

For an example of a markdown presentation check out any of Dr.Collards notes,
or [my first SEV
presentation](https://github.com/EvanPurkhiser/Presentations/blob/gh-pages/presentations/04-09-13-SEV-software-aging.md).

#### Viewing the presentation

The easiest way to view the presentation is to use pythons built in HTTP
server.

````sh
$ cd presentations
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
```

Then in a web browser load <http://localhost:8000/presentation.html>. If your
changes don't show up as you're editing the presentation then you may have to
clear you're cache or do a hard refresh.

#### Other Themes

If anyone on the team is insterested, we could use a different reveal.js theme. Check them out [here](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/themes).
